# google-apps-script-files-misc

This repository is a container for a miscellaneous assortment of single script projects done with *Google Apps Script*. In my mind, it did not make sense to create a repo for each one of them. Below is a short description for each one of them.

## chemical-equation-formatter

This script is bound to a *Google Doc*. When run, it takes the text highlighted by the user and turns any *chemical equation like* pattern and formats it accordingly. 

Examples: 

| Initial Text | Becomes... |
| --- | --- |
| BaCl2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) â†’ BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq) | BaCl<sub>2</sub> <sub>(aq)</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(aq)</sub> â†’ BaSO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(s)</sub> + 2NaCl <sub>(aq)</sub> |
| Ba 2+ (aq) + 2Cl - (aq) + 2 Na + (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) â†’ BaSO4 (s) + 2Na + (aq) + 2Cl - (aq) | Ba <sup>2+</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> + 2Cl <sup>-</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 Na <sup>+</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> + SO4 <sup>2-</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> â†’ BaSO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(s)</sub> + 2Na + <sub>(aq)</sub> + 2Cl <sup>-</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> |
| Ba 2+ (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) â†’ BaSO4 (s) | Ba <sup>2+</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> + SO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2-</sup> <sub>(aq)</sub> â†’ BaSO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(s)</sub> |

## delete-old-form-responses

This script is bound to a *Google Form*. It is activated automatically when an editor opens the form. It deletes all responses on the form that are older than 14 days. This was originally made to help a friend who works at an afterschool program implement an item checkout and return system. The script would keep the responses from getting cluttered. The age needed before deletion could be easily adapted for use in other projects.

## hybrid-meeting-av-scheduling-tool

This script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. It has multiple functions that can be run to help with scheduling brothers who help out at the [meetings](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/meetings/video-kingdom-hall/) of Jehovah's Witnesses. Each person has the jobs they can do, as well as parts they have already been scheduled for. The goal is to schedule without any *conflicts*.

## make-folders-by-week

This script is unbound. When run, it creates numbered folders for each week from the start date to the end date. This was originally made to help a friend who works at an afterschool program prepare *Google Drive* folders for the year. 

## mastermind-game-pvp

This script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. It implements a multiplayer version of *Mastermind*, where up to 4 players can race to finish the same puzzle, or puzzles created for each other, first. The game is played within the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbS8g0OFPeNBDlU8RlJDZjJ-mJ7ELOjlkFiQfrP_c7Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## mastermind-game-solver

This script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. It implements a solver for the game *Mastermind*. After inputting the guesses made so far and their result, the *best* next guess is proposed. The solver is run within the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZpNXu9WKU0gVewmiPm0RZIYGGJAD7vWg9oVf_-eFhW4/edit?usp=sharing).

## meeting-part-colorizer

This script is bound to a *Google Doc*. When run, it looks at the whole document and turns and paragraph that starts with the pattern `{letter}:`, and makes the text have a specific color. As of now there is no driver function, so the function just uses `V` as the letter and ![ðŸŸ¦](https://via.placeholder.com/15/6495ed/000000?text=+) cornflowerblue as the color. 

## organize-availability-survey-results

This script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. When run, it takes the results for a survey and creates a sheet for each unique response for a given question. This sheet will have a `=QUERY()` formula added that will grab all the responses from the main response sheet (one linked to a *Google Form*) that have that specific answer choice. The `=QUERY()` will also sort the responses slightly. This was originally made to sort the student responses for a tutoring availability survey. The original add-on that was being used was breaking due to some answer choices having unescaped double quotes (" should go to "") and lengths exceeding the maximum allowed for sheet names (100 characters). 

## spreadsheet-clear-button

The script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. It is used to turn a checkbox in the spreadsheet into a button that, when pressed, can clear the specified ranges. It was originally used in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195ul3KdEFZaGhNWL1mMsM4DROljqJjMe1tDiTwqPwag/edit?usp=sharing), a table to help tally up the attendance at a *Zoom* meeting based on responses to an *Attendance Poll*. The concept of a checkbox button was used in other GAS projects.

## sudoku-solver

This script is bound to a *Google Sheet*. It implements a tool that can solve sudoku puzzles input to it by the user. The solver is run within the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CF_d9LHpsUOCUEeweVw9jZAEDGYXQ1NMbZgUT7FlSko/edit?usp=sharing).

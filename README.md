# google-apps-script-files-misc

This repository is a container for a miscellaneous assortment of single script projects done with *Google Apps Script*. In my mind, it did not make sense to create a repo for each one of them. Below is a short description for each one of them.

## chemical-equation-formatter

This script is bound to a *Google Doc*. When run, it takes the text highlighted by the user and turns any *chemical equation like* pattern and formats it accordingly. For example, 

>  BaCl2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)

would become

<blockquote>BaCl<sub>2</sub> <sub>(aq)</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(aq)</sub> → BaSO<sub>4</sub> <sub>(s)</sub> + 2NaCl <sub>(aq)</sub></blockquote>
